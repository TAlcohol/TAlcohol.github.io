<h2>Hi there &#128075;</h2>

<p>After learning Computational <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Physics</span> during my undergrad, I became
    a data
    product manager at <a href="https://www.shanbay.com/">shanbay.com</a> where I
    developed my analytical skills. Then I decided to further my study in <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Data
        Science</span>.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about injecting my product sense into the business.</p>

<p>In my daily life, I also love to build web-apps to assist my daily life efficiency in <span
        style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Python, C++, JavaScript,
        Node.js,
        Vue.js, Express, Flask.</span></p>
